## The infection prevention and control evidence plot

This repository contains the code and data to run the infection prevention and control evidence plot.  The interactive evidence plot is still in alpha phase and is used internally by CochraneCF to support the Infection Prevention and Control Guildeline Development Group of the Cystic Fibrosis Trust.  

To download the software on the data, click on the green "code" button.  Then click download zip.  Copy the files out of the zip folder into a folder of your choosing, and then work on them from there.  

## Roadmap for future development

1. An interactive mode such that when you click on a research article, it changes colour to indicate you are including it.
2. An ability to download the dataset_links file after you have edited it so that you are able to work on it over a number of sessions.
3. An ability to automaically upload the datset_links file to the central repository to allow future collaboration.
